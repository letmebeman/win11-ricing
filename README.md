# read before use
This is a work in progress project that im doing for myself but feel free to copy my rice or get inspiration from it.
Ps: it is a bit laggy and some applications don’t work as intended and need to be full screened. 
also the more apps you have opened the more ram you consume.

# curent issues:
after using komogui mouse snaps in to center of screen when moving windows.
temporary fix: manualy change komorebi config. mouse snapping false
